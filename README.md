# Payroll_Dashboard

## Overview
In the payroll dashboard project, SQL is utilized to clean and prepare payroll data by handling inconsistencies value, ensuring accurate calculations for salaries, leave, scheduled hours. The cleaning process involves data validation, standardizing formats, and organizing the payroll data for effective analysis.
Once the data is cleaned, Tableau is employed for visualization, transforming the cleaned data into interactive dashboards. These dashboards allow for the exploration of key metrics such as employee salary distributions, overtime payments, and overall payroll expenses. The goal of the project is to provide a comprehensive, easy-to-interpret view of the companyâ€™s payroll structure and emp[loyee dashboard, offering insights that help in financial planning, compliance monitoring, and payroll cost management and personal salary.
